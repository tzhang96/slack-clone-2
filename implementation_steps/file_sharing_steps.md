## High-Level Overview

To add file sharing, you’ll build an upload feature that allows users to select a file, upload it to a secure storage, and send a message containing a link (and/or preview) of that file. The main components involved include:

1. A UI element (e.g., a button or icon) to trigger file selection.  
2. An API endpoint or existing Supabase functionality to upload the file and retrieve a public URL.  
3. A way to attach the file’s link/metadata to a message (or a new database table if you prefer).  
4. A rendering logic in the chat UI to display the file as a downloadable link or embedded preview.

This approach keeps the user experience consistent with standard messaging apps: files appear in the chat history alongside text messages, and users can preview or download them quickly.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up File Storage (Supabase or Other Service)**
   - In Supabase:  
     - Create a new Bucket (e.g., "chat-files").  
     - Configure the bucket’s access policies (public or restricted) so files can be read by users.  
   - Alternatively, if you prefer a different service (like AWS S3), set that up instead.

2. **Create or Extend Your API Route**
   - Set up a new route (e.g., /api/files) or extend your existing messages API.  
   - This route should accept a file upload request, validate the file, then store it in your chosen file storage.  
   - After successful upload, generate a publicly accessible URL from the storage service.

3. **Enhance the Database (Optional)**
   - Option A: Use an extra column in the existing messages table to store file-related metadata (like file URL).  
   - Option B: Create a new files table linking the file record to a message or user.  
     - Example schema:  
       - id: uuid (PK)  
       - message_id: references messages.id  
       - file_url: string  
       - file_name: string  
       - file_size: number  
       - created_at: timestamp  

4. **Add Front-End UI for File Upload**
   - Place a small “Attach File” icon or button near your “MessageInput” component.  
     - Tailwind Example:  
       - “absolute top-0 right-0 mr-2 mt-2 text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-800”  
   - When clicked, open a file picker (HTML <input type="file"> or similar).  
   - Collect the file(s) upon selection.

5. **Implement File Upload Logic**
   - In your “MessageInput” component (or a new dedicated component):  
     - Listen for file selection events (onChange).  
     - Immediately upload the file to /api/files or to Supabase directly.  
     - Retrieve the resulting file URL once the upload completes.

6. **Attach File URL to the Message**
   - Once the file upload succeeds, you’ll include the file URL in the message content or store it separately.  
   - If you’re adding it to the message content:  
     - Set content to something like: “Check out this file: {PublicFileURL}”.  
   - If storing it in a new files table, you could still push a normal message referencing that file record.

7. **Display Files in the Chat UI**
   - In “MessageList” or “MessageItem”:  
     - Check if a message contains a file URL (or has a related file record).  
     - Render a preview or a link. For example:  
       - For images, show an <img> with Tailwind classes to keep it responsive.  
       - For other file types, show a download link or a small file icon.

8. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add file size validations or file type restrictions in the upload process for security.  
   - Implement upload progress indicators (e.g., a small progress bar in the message).  
   - Provide thumbnail previews for common file types (images, PDFs, etc.).  
   - Store file metadata (name, size, type) in your database to display in the chat UI.

9. **Testing and Iteration**
   - Ensure the entire flow (select file → upload → confirm → display link) works seamlessly on multiple browsers and mobile devices.  
   - Verify that your security rules (RLS in Supabase or other) protect against unauthorized uploads or downloads.  
   - Add graceful error handling (e.g., when storage is unreachable or if the file is too large).

By following these steps, you integrate file sharing without disrupting the existing design. Users can now attach and view files just like text messages, enhancing the collaboration features of your chat application.
