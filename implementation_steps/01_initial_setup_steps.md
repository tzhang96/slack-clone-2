1. Set up Next.js project with Supabase
a. Initialize Next.js 13+ project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
b. Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
c. Install key dependencies: @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs, @supabase/supabase-js
d. Create database tables and relationships in Supabase
e. Set up initial project structure following the component hierarchy

COMPLETION NOTES:
- Created Next.js 13+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router for modern, type-safe development
- Set up Supabase project and added environment variables in .env.local for secure configuration
- Installed Supabase client libraries for authentication and real-time features
- Created comprehensive database schema (schema.sql) with:
  * Users table with email, username, and full_name (matches PRD data model)
  * Channels table with name and description
  * Messages table with proper foreign keys and constraints
  * Added indexes for performance and RLS policies for security
- Established project structure following PRD's component hierarchy:
  * /components/layout/ for shared layouts
  * /components/auth/ for authentication forms
  * /components/chat/ for ChannelList and MessageList
  * /components/shared/ for reusable UI components
  * /lib/ for utilities like Supabase client
This foundation directly aligns with the PRD's technical architecture and prepares us for implementing the core features: authentication, channels, and real-time messaging.

2. Implement Authentication Flow
a. Create AuthLayout component with shared styling for auth pages
b. Build login/signup forms with form validation using react-hook-form
c. Implement Supabase auth methods for email/password authentication
d. Set up protected routes and authentication middleware
e. Create auth context for managing user state throughout the app

COMPLETION NOTES:
- Created reusable UI components for consistent styling:
  * Button component with loading states and variants
  * Input component with error handling and labels
- Built AuthLayout for a professional authentication experience
- Implemented comprehensive form validation using react-hook-form and zod:
  * Email format validation
  * Password length requirements
  * Username format and length constraints
  * Full name length validation
- Set up Supabase authentication with:
  * Email/password signup and login
  * User metadata storage (username, full_name)
  * Session management and persistence
  * Automatic profile creation in users table
  * Race condition handling in profile creation
  * Error handling for duplicate usernames/emails
- Created AuthProvider context for global auth state:
  * User session management
  * Login/signup/logout functions
  * Loading states for better UX
  * Automatic session restoration
  * Real-time auth state synchronization
- Added authentication pages with navigation:
  * /login with link to signup
  * /signup with link to login
  * Automatic redirection to /chat after authentication
  * Protected routes requiring authentication
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
  * Users can view all users (for mentions/profiles)
  * Users can only update their own profile
  * Users can only insert their own profile data
This implementation provides a secure, user-friendly authentication system that matches the PRD's requirements for user management and security.

3. Create Basic Chat Layout
a. Build ChatLayout component with sidebar and main content area
b. Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
c. Create channel list component with static data initially
d. Set up navigation between channels using Next.js routing
e. Add loading states and error boundaries

COMPLETION NOTES:
- Created ChatLayout component with:
  * Fixed sidebar and main content area
  * Clean, minimal design with proper spacing
  * Border and background color separation
- Created ChannelList component with:
  * Static list of initial channels
  * Channel selection and active state
  * Proper hover and focus states
  * TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implemented channel routing with:
  * Dynamic routes for each channel (/chat/[channelId])
  * Automatic redirect from /chat to general channel
  * Active channel state management
  * TypeScript-safe channel validation
- Added loading and error states:
  * Skeleton loading UI for channel switches
  * Error boundary for invalid channels
  * Error recovery with retry option
  * Maintained sidebar access during errors
SKIPPED/TODO:
- Mobile-first responsive design (b)
  * Hamburger menu for mobile
  * Slide-out sidebar on mobile
  * Touch-friendly interactions
This implementation provides a solid foundation for the chat interface, with proper routing and error handling, though mobile responsiveness will need to be addressed later.

4. Message Functionality
a. Create message list component with virtual scrolling for performance
b. Build message input component with basic validation
c. Implement message sending functionality with optimistic updates
d. Set up message fetching with pagination
e. Add loading states and error handling for message operations

COMPLETION NOTES:
- Created MessageList component with:
  * Virtual scrolling using react-window for performance
  * Dynamic message height calculation
  * Proper message formatting and styling
  * Avatar placeholders with user initials
- Built MessageInput component with:
  * Character limit validation (4000 chars)
  * Visual feedback for remaining characters
  * Auto-expanding textarea
  * Submit on Enter, new line on Shift+Enter
- Implemented message sending with:
  * Optimistic updates for instant feedback
  * Error handling with rollback
  * Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Added loading and error states:
  * Loading spinner during initial fetch
  * Error message with retry button
  * Disabled input during send operations

TODO:
- Message pagination (d)
  * Implement cursor-based pagination
  * "Load more" button or infinite scroll
  * Maintain scroll position when loading
- Real-time updates (will be part of Step 5)
  * Subscribe to new messages
  * Handle message edits/deletions
  * Show typing indicators
- Channel Management Authorization
  * Add role-based access control for channel deletion
  * Only allow channel creators or admins to delete channels
  * Update RLS policies to enforce channel management permissions
  * Add UI indicators for deletion permissions

5. Real-time Messaging
a. Set up Supabase real-time subscriptions for messages
b. Implement message broadcast to all channel members
c. Add message queue for handling offline/online states
d. Create real-time connection status indicator
e. Handle reconnection logic and message syncing

6. Channel Creation
a. Build channel creation modal with form validation
b. Implement channel creation API endpoint
c. Add new channel to channel list with optimistic update
d. Set up channel joining functionality
e. Add validation for channel names and duplicates
